This paper proposes the SMART framework to address the challenge of Small Language Models (SLMs) in multi-step, complex reasoning tasks. An LLM selectively intervenes to assist the SLM''s reasoning process only when necessary. This approach evaluates the confidence of the SLM''s reasoning results, and if the score is low, the LLM provides a corrected reasoning step, significantly boosting SLM performance while minimizing LLM usage.'
