Conventional multiplexed cyclic imaging techniques have limitations, as the signal removal process can alter tissue integrity. This paper introduces IMPASTO, a novel method that iterates imaging cycles without signal removal and uses a self-supervised AI model to unmix the signals, isolating individual protein images. This technique enables high-dimensional imaging while minimizing tissue damage.'
