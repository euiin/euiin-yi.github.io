This research focuses on detecting road floods in nighttime driving videos. The study proposes a deep learning model that learns spatiotemporal representations from vehicle black-box footage to effectively detect flooded road conditions, even in low-light and poor visibility environments. The work contributes to enhancing the safety of intelligent transportation systems.'
